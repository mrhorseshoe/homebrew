							"When a vampire sires a dhampir child, it passes along the curse that runs through its veins as well. Although more obscure curses exist, the three prevailing curses that afflict vampires are the Curse of Dread, the Curse of the Feral, and the Curse of Nobility. These curses manifest in dhampirs as three subraces: dreadblood, feralblood, and nobleblood.",
							"Dreadblood dhampirs inspire melancholy and creeping terror in those around them, leading many to take up lives of study where they can hide away from others. Feralblood dhampirs exhibit an unnerving affinity for predatory beasts and a greater bloodlust than other dhampirs. Nobleblood dhampirs possess an unnatural charisma and hypnotic presence that they sometimes employ to build small communities or cults to their name."

							"Many dhampirs take up adventuring for at least some portion of their life. Dhampirs tend to view the world in stark black and white and this thinking extends to their motivations for adventuring. Some dhampirs might take up adventuring to fight against the evil force of the world or to right the wrongs of their vampiric parent. Other dhampirs choose to adventure as a means of quickly amassing a personal fortune, or a collection of mystical artifacts, in pursuit personal power or vampiric apotheosis."
