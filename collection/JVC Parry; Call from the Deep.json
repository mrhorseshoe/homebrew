						"You are about to set sail on an epic adventure that thrusts the heroes into the middle of a pirate-filled mystery. {@i Call from the Deep} is a {@i Dungeons & Dragons} 5th Edition campaign for four to six player characters. Players should start with 1st level characters and reach at least 10th level by the campaign's conclusion.",
						"The campaign takes place in the Forgotten Realms, specifically in a region known as the Sword Coast, on the western shore of Faerûn and the seas beyond. Nonetheless, you can easily adapt the adventure to your home campaign by changing the names of various locations and factions.",
						"I recommend that you read the entire campaign before attempting to run it. This introduction begins with an \"{@adventure Adventure Background|CallfromtheDeep|1|Adventure Background}\" section that summarizes the events that set the adventure in motion. The \"{@adventure Running the Adventure|CallfromtheDeep|1|Running the Adventure}\" section tells you everything you need to know to run the adventure smoothly. That section also presents guidelines for character level advancement, outlines the flow of the adventure, and describes its major challenges.

This coastline is populated by a wealth of different folk from the Savage Frontier in the north down to the nation of Amn in the south. The settlements on the coast and the Island Kingdoms of the Sea of Swords and Trackless Sea are the primary settings of this campaign, but other inland locations may feature more prominently during your playthrough. For additional information on these locations, consult the {@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|scag}.",
								"The coastline itself is perilous and changeable. In the north is the Sea of Moving Ice, filled with great bergs that shatter the hulls of unwary ships. Further south lies calmer waters and friendly ports and cities, such as Neverwinter, Waterdeep, and Baldur's Gate. Despite the existence of these havens, Red Rocks isn't the only thing that will sink your vessel. Pirates from Luskan and The Northlander Isles roam the coast, targeting merchant galleys and bullying fishing boats. The seas too are cruel, harbouring hideous monsters, tempestuous squalls and unseen horrors in their depths.",

										"Entirely alien to most of the common folk of the Realms, the illithid, or mind flayers, formed an empire of psionic hive mind slavers who brought devastation to populations of sentient creatures. Over many centuries, and across innumerate worlds, these tentacled nightmares subjected thousands of races to psychic torture, breaking their will and turning them into thralls. Telepathically united, these aberrations traversed the Outer Planes in nautiloids, ships attuned to their needs, in search of races to enslave.",
										"One of these races were the gith. Although they were dominated for centuries by the illithid, somehow the gith revolted against their oppressors, overthrowing their empire and scattering the remaining mind flayers far and wide. Although the details of the uprising are unknown, the illithid and gith (who became two separate races, the githyanki and githzerai), still hold utter contempt for each other. The gith actively seek out Illithid to destroy, and mind flayers seek githyanki crèches on the Material Plane to subjugate and torture. For more information about the gith and illithid conflict, known as the Endless War, see {@book chapter 4 of Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|mtf|3}.",
										"In recent times, most surviving Illithid are scattered across the Astral Plane. A few made it to other worlds, where they continue to harvest brains and create thralls. Numerous sects of illithid have taken up home in the Underdark, the vast network of caverns beneath Faerûn. Here, hidden in the shadows, they devour the brains of sentient creatures to sustain themselves.",
										"Illithid culture is founded on knowledge and understanding. As well as consuming brains for sustenance, mind flayers also receive memories and wisdom stored within their victims' brains, which is immediately transmitted throughout their colony telepathically. At the head of these colonies are Elder Brains. These beings of supreme intelligence manage the illithid communities, accessing the information they hold and using it to further the will of the race. Their goals are known as The Grand Design, which focusses on rebuilding their lost empire, and subjugating their remaining enemies."

Through the absorption of dead illithid brains, Zellix'Phor came to know the causes of the empire's fall and is obsessed with vengeance. Driven by bloodlust, the illithid colony that follows Zellix'Phor searches across the Planes of Existence for githyanki crèches, hoping to decimate their population through infanticide.",
										"Zellix'Phor had become a name that elated mind flayers and brought dread into the hearts of the gith. His devastating effect upon the githyanki population was well known, and horrifying stories were told within that culture of the silent and deadly arrival of the illithid vessel which housed Zellix'Phor and his disciples.",
										"Over time, the colony of Zellix'Phor grew to a point where it could barely sustain itself. All available nautiloid space was dedicated to the illithid, and their thralls were jettisoned to make room for the superior race. The need for brains to fuel the mind flayers meant that the nautiloid in which the colony lived was visiting the Material Plane ever more frequently. Despite generations of tactical warfare knowledge assimilated by the Zellix'Phor, his arrogance became his downfall. The gith had been tracking the nautiloid across the Planes, waiting for the right time to strike. Believing himself invincible, Zellix'Phor commanded the vessel to dock on the Material Plane to stock up on brains, and the ship was attacked.",
										"Githyanki knights, the fiercest and most formidable warriors of the martial race, struck the nautiloid with immeasurable force. They entered the vessel as assassins and decimated the illithid within. Without their thralls to take the brunt of the assault, the mind flayers were on the front line, and despite their formidable psionic capabilities, many were struck down by the silver swords of the Githyanki. The nautiloid crash-landed on the Northlander Isle of Gundarlun, killing nearly all aboard. Unfortunately, Zellix'Phor and his closest attendants managed to survive, sheltered from the destruction in the elder brain chamber of the nautiloid.

The elder brain is arrogant and believes themselves to be invincible, unable to be outsmarted or outmatched.",

In generations past, most human settlers of the Island Kingdoms were fair-haired and light-skinned. Since then, the riches and promise of the islands have attracted folk from other regions, and several generations of cultural mingling has given the humans of Faerûn much greater diversity in their appearance (see \"{@footnote {@race human|phb|Human Names and Ethnicities}|See the {@i Info} tab of the {@race human} race.}\" in chapter 2 of the {@i Player's Handbook})."

Northfolk ancestors built small villages along the Sword Coast that have since become cities, including fabled Illusk (now Luskan), Eigersstor (now Neverwinter), and Nimoar's Hold (now Waterdeep). These early Northlanders farmed the rocky coastlines, fished coastal waters, and hunted seals and whales on the open sea.",

These people farm, fish, and mine their rugged lands, then shrewdly trade their goods with foreign buyers. Many once-feared tribes have become merchants whose bartering skills are equal to or better than the warlike talents of their ancestors, such that many a Northlander merchant earns more booty than their raiding neighbours. In many cases, however, the Northlanders of the Island Kingdoms still uphold the raiding and reaving culture of their past.

										"Eons ago, the city of Ascarle was built by moon elves on the northern coast of what came to be known as Trisk of Purple Rocks. They built the city from coral and crystal as they venerated {@deity Deep Sashelas|Elven|mtf} above all other deities. For centuries the elves lived in peace, cultivating unique architecture and art using the materials the ocean provided.",
										"Unfortunately, peace could not last forever. Word of the rich city spread to the drow inhabiting the Underdark, who saw the chance to strike at an unsuspecting elven city and claim its treasures. Motivated by the bitter hatred of {@deity Lolth|Drow|mtf}, the drow sacked the city, killing many elves and routing the rest. The drow desecrated many of the shrines dedicated to {@deity Deep Sashelas|Elven|mtf}, but were kept from entering his most holy temple in the subterranean layer of the city by flooding the chambers with seawater. After spending less than a decade in their captured city, the drow returned to the Underdark.",
										"Over the next century, the ruins of Ascarle were claimed by the Northern ice, which fractured the earth beneath the city, dragging it into the ocean as the glacier melted. Not long after, Slarkrethel discovered this new addition to his underwater realm and claimed it as his own. Since then, Slarkrethel has laired in Ascarle, appointing various evil wardens as Regent to guard the city. The most recent Regent was a rogue illithid named Vestress, who came to power in the 13th century DR.",
										"In the Year of Maidens 1361 DR, the city was assaulted by the drow Lireal Baenre who fatally wounded Vestress and freed the captives from the city. Vestress was interred by the new Regent of Ascarle, an elven queen turned deathlock by Slarkrethel named Shava the Damned.",
										"Within the past year, a major power shift has occurred. Slarkrethel has been dominated by Zellix'Phor, who was grafted into the kraken's skull. Zellix'Phor's illithid colony has taken up host in Ascarle, gaining command over the kraken's followers.",

Taking the {@action Dash} action allows a ship to move twice as fast as it normally would, but may require a successful Strength check at the DMs discretion. A ship that {@action Dodge|phb|Dodges} is assumed to be manoeuvred in such a way as to make it harder to hit.",

										"The Stormchaser is a close to a floating temple as you can imagine. The great wooden vessel is constructed for the sole purpose of getting as close to storms as possible. Here, in the heart of the tempest, the priests of {@deity Talos|Faerûnian|scag} can commune with their god, gaining insight into the future, how best to destroy their foes, and where the greatest storms will appear for their next sermon. Despite this seemingly foolhardy quest, the Stormchaser has not yet been harmed by a squall, perhaps because the clergy aboard are truly devout.",
										"As well as chasing storms, the caravel plays a lesser role as protector and extorter. The ship is well known along the Sword Coast as a pirate-killer, but Stormlord Arden does this for profit, not for good. If the Stormchaser comes across a pirate vessel, it uses its {@object ballista|dmg|ballistae} to fire swinging chain bolts, which are perfect for shattering masts and tearing sails. Once the pirates are immobilised, the priests call down bolts of lightning to strike the vessel, sinking it to the depths. If the Stormchaser spots other, civilised vessels, it pulls up dangerously close and asks for protection payment. Without the Stormchaser, Stormlord Arden claims, their ships would be raided by pirates and wrecked by storms. A few hundred gold pieces is a fair price."

Dhurge was born with the typical baron mutations (increased strength and extra limbs), but rather than fighting his way to the top of sahuagin society, as most barons do, Dhurge took a different route. While attacking a ship as a juvenile, Dhurge came across a {@item wand of fireballs} and quickly realised how to use the item. The power afforded to him by the item inspired him to search out more and more wands until he had a full set. By the time Dhurge was fully grown, he has discovered more wands than his hands could carry and had mastered their use. The arcane casting didn't go down well with the sahuagin of Kressilacc, Dhurge's home, so he headed south to the Nelanthers where he knew he could find work as a pirate. Here he was approached by Sea King Tentrix, who recruited him into the Black Armada.",

He thinks highly of Tentrix, whose charismatic leadership has united dozens of crews under his command. Dhurge is a four-armed sahuagin with intelligent, beady eyes. He wields a wand in each hand, shooting spells at incredible speed. Dhurge wears a long wizard's robe that is always sodden and is covered in parts by a mossy seaweed.",

Tentrix coordinated the attacks on the Sword Coast after receiving a telepathic message from Slarkrethel. Tentrix is excited to be taking the fight to the mainland and eagerly awaits the rewards promised to him by the kraken.

Unfortunately, Tentrix's direct link with Slarkrethel, and therefore Zellix'Phor, means the kraken can use an action to deal 90 psychic damage to Tentrix, killing him instantly. Zellix'Phor does this if Tentrix is about to reveal the location of Ascarle.",

They have learned to rend the hulls of large ships and capsize smaller ones to get to their favourite prey. Perhaps the most peculiar feature of the vodyanoi is its stomach.
