Their ponderous movement fools the unwary into believing that distance equals safety.

Only the largest white dragons surpass the graknork in size and strength, and lesser creatures give the monster a wide berth. Graknorks are mostly found on land but are reasonable swimmers. They have no problem taking to the water to pursue escaping prey or to hunt fishermen and even whales. Graknorks are solitary creatures and cannot stand the presence of their own kind, attacking and eating juvenile graknorks that cross their path. When they do mate, it is a destructive affair with the female uprooting dozens of trees to build her nest. A typical graknork is more than forty feet long, though even larger specimens have been sighted in the coldest regions of the world."

Most of these tales are mere fancy and hearsay spun by northern tribesmen, yet there is no denying that the graknork's central eye is a fearsome weapon."
